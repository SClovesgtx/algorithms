    "# What is hashing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is a technique or process of mapping keys, and values into the hash table by using a hash function. It is done for faster access to elements. The efficiency of mapping depends on the efficiency of the hash function used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let a hash function H(x) maps the value x at the index x%10 in an Array. For example if the list of values is [11,12,13,14,15] it will be stored at positions {1,2,3,4,5} in the array or Hash table respectively."

    "# What is Collision? \n",
    "\n",
    "Since a hash function gets us a small number for a key which is a big integer or string, there is a possibility that two keys result in the same value. The situation where a newly inserted key maps to an already occupied slot in the hash table is called collision and must be handled using some collision handling technique. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What are the chances of collisions with the large table? \n",
    "\n",
    "Collisions are very likely even if we have a big table to store keys. An important observation is Birthday Paradox. With only 23 persons, the probability that two people have the same birthday is 50%."
